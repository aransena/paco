Python Ant Colony Optimisation Implementation

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a biomimetic algorithm which was designed around the natural foraging behaviour of Ants (as the name might suggest), and was first developed in Marco Dorigo in '92.

See https://www.aransena.com/blog/2015/12/22/python-ant-colony-optimization for a full write up on ACO and this implementation.
